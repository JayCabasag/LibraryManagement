**README.md - Library Management System**

![Library Management System](https://your-library-management-system-url.com)

## Description

The Library Management System is a web application developed using MUI5 Next.js and Firebase. It is designed to streamline the process of managing a library, providing an efficient and user-friendly interface for librarians to handle administrative tasks and borrowers to search for and borrow books. With this system, librarians can manage books, borrowers, and book issuance efficiently, while borrowers can easily browse and borrow available books.

This project aims to enhance the overall library experience for both librarians and borrowers by offering a modern, centralized platform for managing library operations.

## Features

- **Book Management**: Add, edit, and delete books in the library database, including details such as title, author, publication date, genre, and available copies.

- **Borrower Management**: Keep track of library members, their details, and borrowing history.

- **Book Issuance and Returns**: Facilitate the process of book borrowing and returning. Automatically update book availability status upon issuance and return.

- **Book Search**: Allow borrowers to search for books based on title, author, genre, or other relevant criteria.

- **Dashboard**: Provide librarians with a dashboard to view the status of issued books, popular books, and other relevant statistics.

- **Fine Management**: Automatically calculate and apply fines for late book returns.
